Bob, the 34 year old man came across a lake. 
He glanced upon the lake and noticed a bottle with something inside of it.
Out of curiosity, Bob went over the the lake and picked up the bottle.
Bob then opened the bottle and saw what was inside the bottle. It was a piece of paper.
Written on that paper, there were coordinates so something special.
There were steps written to find the special item.

1. Go to Barto City
2. Head over to barrier street
3. look for a green building with a big circle on it. 
4. Go inside of the building and talk to the owner
5. Get the owner to allow you to the secret place
6. When you enter the secret place, search for a blue ball
7. When you get the ball, go the the clock and place the ball in the middle.
8. That is when the secret item will be revealed.

Bob then followed those steps, one by one until he reached the clock.
He placed the ball in the clock and found.... WATER!
Bob just wasted his time.
